    <h2 class="pages">About Me</h2>
    <p id="aboutme">Hi, I'm Bruno, a an Engineering student currently studying Telecomunications and Informatic Engineering at Universidade do Minho and for now this is just a personal project as I want to learn more about web development.</p>

    <h2 class="pages">My Projects</h2>

    <a href="https://github.com/xB0SsZz/sudoku-pygame">Sudoku Python</a>
    <p>This is a personal project I did to improve my python knowledge, but specifically to learn more about pygame, a module I had interest to try a long time ago. The project can and probably will have more updates, but for now it is a simple playable version of the classic game Sudoku.</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/xB0SsZz/weather-app">Android Weather App</a>
    <p>Android development is an area that has always caught my eye, and when I got the chance to learn it in university I took it and this is one of two projects I did. It isn't perfect I know, but it was my first ever Kotlin App so I thought it deserved to be here aswell.</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/xB0SsZz/personal-website">My Personal Website</a>
    <p>As it says above, this is another personal project and it is the first website I'm developing. I never had any experience with CSS or Javascript so I thought this was an opportunity to learn and at the same time who knows create something nice I can actually use.</p>
